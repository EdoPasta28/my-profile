        <p>I love fashion, cooking and movies. I've recently started a self-improvement month and this website is a proof of that. The aim of this initiative is to inspire people around the world to try new things and achieve their wildest dreams. In addition, I've recently lunched a start-up and maybe you can check it out by clicking the following button! </p>

        <h2>Fashion</h2>

         <p>Since I was a child, I have always been passionate about fashion. As a matter of fact, for mr it has never been only about clothes or accessories. Instead, I truly believe that Fashion is one of the greatest forms of art. Exactly for this reason, I hope I will be able to transform this passion of mine into a job. </p>

        <h2>Cooking</h2>

        <p>My relationship with cooking started not very far in the past. Instead, it was 3 years ago, when I had to live on my own for 5 motnhs. In that period, I realized how important it is to master such a very important skill like cooking. Today, since I live alone, this subject is no more something I need to do, but rather an activity I love to get myself into. In this way I can stay healthy and not only experience new flavors, but also get in touch with new cultures.</p>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>Starting from Disney movies when I was a child, to vintage ones today, cinematography has always been an intriguing topic for me. Everytime, a good story of a movie is able to capture my attention for hours and trasnport me into a completely new world. As a proof of that, I can watch more than two movies a day since I make it a priority of mine. </p>

        <h2>Follow me</h2>
        <p>Infortunately I don't have any social media. However, if you really want to meet me, you can come any tuesday, during the afternoon to a cafè called "the Cafèotheque of Paris". I am a regular there and I am always  looking for someone new to meet.</p>
